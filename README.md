# sparta_global_C-_game
This is a recreation on my JavaScript game Link Letters. In this version of Link Letters I have implemented the game with three difficulties, easy, medium and hard. The main aim of the game is to link the characters together to display the missing words on a grid. Once all the words are found you have completed that level.

The difference between this game and the JavaScript game is my login and sign up window which allows you to create a user with a avatar. This allows you to have a score that will be displayed on the leader board window. The leader board window will display users that have completed a level, showing the level name along with how long they spent in that level.

Have fun and good luck!
